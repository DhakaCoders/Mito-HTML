          <p>They can’t keep up with the younger athletes because their mitochondria simply aren’t producing the power their muscles need.</p>
          <p>Their heart muscles grow a little weaker …</p>
          <p>Their leg muscles lose a little strength …</p>
          <p>And in just a few short years and M.V.P. caliber player could be out of the league.</p>
          <p>That’s how fast it happens when you’re playing at these elite levels.</p>

          <p>Which means it’s nearly impossible to get the clinical dose of this powerful ingredient from either your diet or regular Carnitine supplements.</p>
          <p>Second, they didn’t just use any old L-Carnitine.</p>
          <p>There used two specific forms of L-Carnitine that are essential for any man over 40 …</p>
          <p>Because of the specific benefits they provide for male vitality and energy.</p>
          <p>The first one is called Glycine Propionyl <br> L-Carnitine, or GPLC, and it’s the <strong>only nutritional compound</strong> ever shown to boost blood nitric oxide levels across multiple studies.</p>

          <p>Like any form of L-Carnitine, GPLC helps “reboot” your mitochondria …</p>
          <p>So they can churn out more of the energy your cells need to function effectively.</p>
          <p>But thanks to the added Glycine and Propionyl groups in this unique patented compound, GPLC seems to have an added benefit.</p>
          <p>It works especially well on your endothelial cells.</p>
          <p>Now in case you don’t remember, the endothelium is a small, single layer of cells lining your arteries …</p>
          <p>That are responsible for producing a compound called nitric oxide.</p>

          <p>Now, I’m sure you’ve heard the expression “opening up the floodgates” before …</p>
          <p>Well that’s exactly what happens when you boost the nitric oxide levels in the blood.</p>
          <p>Your blood vessels expand and send a raging river of oxygen and nutrient rich blood <em>everywhere in your body</em>.</p>
          <p>Now, as I’m sure your beginning to understand, healthy mitochondria are essential if you want your endothelial cells working at full capacity.</p>

          <p>In fact, by the time you hit 70, your endothelial cells ability to create nitric oxide plummets by more than 50%.</p>
          <p>But GPLC helps “reboot” the mitochondria in the endothelial cells, restoring their ability to churn out nitric oxide when you were young.</p>

          <p>In fact, in a recent study out of the Indian Institute of Technology, researchers took two group of mice and forced them to exercise to the point of chronic fatigue over 21 days.</p>
          <p>One group was simply fed a normal diet and the other group supplemented with a moderate dose of Shilajit.</p>

          <p>Now I haven’t talked about it until now, but every single one of these guidelines is important.  </p>
          <p>There are many companies out there that like to cut corners to save costs …</p>
          <p>All at the expense of performance.</p>
          <p>Some companies create “proprietary blends”.</p>
          <p>In my experience, it’s just a way for them to add a bunch of useless fillers to the product while cutting the amount of the expensive, effective ingredients it delivers.</p>
          <p>Other companies just straight up under dose their products or use inferior versions of the ingredients.</p>

          <p>So let me show exactly what you’re getting in each serving of Mito Male:</p>
          <p>First, you get 2 grams of Acetyl L-Carnitine and 2g of Propionyl L-Carnitine to make your mitochondria more efficient and effective …</p>
          <p>In one breakthrough study by two Italian scientists showed this potent Carnitine Cocktail actually improved sexual performance in a group of older males up to 200% better than testosterone injections.</p>
          <p>We use Acetyl L-Carnitine for two reasons.</p>

          <p>And we use Propionyl L-Carnitine because of its potent effects on the circulatory system and the Leydig cells that produce testosterone.</p>
          <p>Then we add 250 mg of Shilajit to stop mitochondrial decay in its tracks …</p>
          <p>Plus, Shilajit has been used for centuries in Indian medicine as a potent way to boost male vitality … It’s even called “the destroyer of weakness” because of its reputed effects on the libido. </p>
          <p>Finally, there’s step 3: you add in 20 mg of PQQ to help your body become a mitochondrial making machine.</p>
          <p>This adds the horsepower to your cellular engines … helping your body build more muscle, lose weight and supercharge your sexual performance so you .</p>
          <p>But that’s not all.</p>
          <p>I also added 30mg of zinc and 10mg of boron.</p>

                <p>This could be your defining moment.</p>
                <p>This could be your Thermopylae … where you take your stand against the ravaging forces of aging …</p>

          <p>But I’m not in this just for the money.</p>
          <p>I wanted to create the perfect formula that I could give to my friends and family and be proud …</p>
          <p>And of course, use myself.</p>
          <p>Which is why I demanded perfection … and that perfection comes at a price.</p>

        <p>And the truth is, we’ve already sold out of <mark class="t_branding">Mito&nbsp;Male</mark> 4 times over the last year alone.</p>
        <p>So if you don’t act right …</p>
        <p>There’s a good chance we may be sold out by the time you make your decision.</p>

          <p>I mentioned at the beginning of this video, testosterone injections can have lots of side effects.</p>
          <p>In fact, using hormone replacement therapies can actually stop your body from producing its own natural testosterone.</p>
          <p>Which can have devastating effects on your body if you ever decide to STOP taking these drugs.</p>
          <p>That’s why I suggest you FORGET about the quick fix …</p>
          <p>And START investing in a better future today.</p>
          <p>By building healthier, stronger mitochondria that give you the energy, strength and vitality …</p>
          <p>To look younger, feel younger and perform at younger levels every single day.</p>
