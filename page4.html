          <p>The levels of this protein naturally decline with age …</p>

          <p>And were one of the main reasons for their legendary prowess.</p>
          <p>Now, the ancients had known for thousands of years that this compound was a remarkable vitality enhancer …</p>
          <p>But until recently, scientists didn’t know why.</p>
          <p>But a recent set of studies has determined two very specific reasons why this natural compound is so potent.</p>
          <p>First, Shilajit contains powerful antioxidants called dibenzo alpha pyrones …</p>
          <p>That specifically target and eliminate the free radicals that attack your mitochondrial DNA.</p>

          <p>In fact, in a recent study out of the Indian Institute of Technology, researchers took two group of mice and forced them to exercise to the point of chronic fatigue over 21 days.</p>
          <p>One group was simply fed a normal diet and the other group supplemented with a moderate dose of Shilajit.</p>
          <p>The researchers then recorded 9 different measurements of mitochondrial damage across the two groups.</p>
          <p>And get this …</p>
          <p>The group that was fed the normal diet saw their rate of mitochondrial decay soar by up to 200% over those 21 days …</p>
          <p>Which sent their anxiety levels soaring and made it so these mice could barely move a muscle.</p>
          <p>However, the group that took Shilajit <strong>had no signs of any mitochondrial damage …</strong></p>

          <p>But that’s just the beginning.</p>
          <p>Because Shilajit also contains a powerful compound called fulvic acid.</p>
          <p>Fulvic acid helps shuttle essential minerals deep into your cells …</p>
          <p>Where they can be used in millions of biological reactions.</p>

          <p>The second is Zinc.</p>
          <p>Having enough zinc is essential to maintaining optimal hormone levels.</p>
          <p>But the crazy thing is, we can’t store zinc in our bodies.</p>
          <p>Which is why it’s essential to make sure you’re getting enough zinc from your diet every single day.</p>
          <p>Because if your body is zinc deficient, your testosterone levels will plummet like a rock.</p>
          <p>In short, both of these minerals play a vital part in maintaining dozens of important anabolic pathways in the body.</p>
          <p>Which is why they are both an essential part of the RPM method.</p>
